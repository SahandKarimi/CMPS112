CMPS112: Comparative Programming Languages; Taken in Spring 2019 with Professor Owen Arden

Covers several programming languages and compares styles, philosophy, and design principles. Principles underlying declarative, functional, and object-oriented programming styles are studied. Students write programs emphasizing each of these techniques. 

Assignments included the following:
- Trying to work out Lambda Caculus reductions and trying to come up with our own lambda expressions
- Using helper functions and recursion to find elements in a list in Haskell
- Randomly generating expressions, and evaluating those expressions to create random generated artwork
- Finding a key,value pair in a dictionary using tail recursion, and doing other operations using tail recursion
- Using helper functions with accumulators and using foldL and foldR to accomplish some sort of list manipulation
- Developing a psuedo language called Nano, where we had to take care of the evaulation of and parsing of the language, along with making a lexer that could recognize the language
- Developing a type checking system for the above language, in which we would have to be able to infer and unify different data types using Haskell
